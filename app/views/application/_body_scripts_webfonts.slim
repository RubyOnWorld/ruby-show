/ 1. Preemptively warm up the fonts’ origin.
/
/ 2. Initiate a high-priority, asynchronous fetch for the CSS file. Works in

/
/ 3. Initiate a low-priority, asynchronous fetch that gets applied to the page
/    only after it’s arrived. Works in all browsers with JavaScript enabled.
/
/ 4. In the unlikely event that a visitor has intentionally disabled
/    JavaScript, fall back to the original method. The good news is that,
/    although this is a render-blocking request, it can still make use of the
/    preconnect which makes it marginally faster than the default.
